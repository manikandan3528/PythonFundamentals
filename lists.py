# Python has following container data types:
# 1) Lists
# 2) Tuples
# 3) Sets
# 4) Dictionaries

# A list is also known as a dynamic array. It is an ordered collection
# which can be indexed and sliced

# Lists are commonly used for handling variable length data

# List may contains duplicate items

# Though list can contain dissimilar types, usually they are a collection of similar types
# Accessing List Elements
animals = ["cat", "dog", "lion", "tiger"]
ages = [28, 40, 35, 2, 8, 65]

print(animals, ages)

# Like string list can be sliced
# print(animals[1:3])
# print(ages[3:])
#
# import keyword
# print(keyword.kwlist)

#List Operation
# create (=), concatenation (+), merge (+) , searching (in)

#List Methods
# append, remove, pop, insert, reverse, sort, sort (reverse = True), count, index

# List of Lists

# a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# b = [50, 60, 70]
# c = [a, b]
# print(c)
# print(c[0][2], c[1][2])
# print([1, 2, 3, *a])
